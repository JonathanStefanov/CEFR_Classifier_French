# Welcome to the CEFR Level Classifier Project! üöÄ

[![Run in Saturn Cloud](https://saturncloud.io/images/embed/run-in-saturn-cloud.svg)](https://app.community.saturnenterprise.io/dash/o/community/resources?templateId=1eea18712f1c498b81567ea0e854df87)

This application, built using Streamlit üåê, leverages the advanced capabilities of a 3-phase Camembert AI model üßÄ to classify texts into the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR): A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2.

## What is CEFR? üìò
The CEFR is an internationally recognized standard for describing language ability. It's widely used across the globe to assess and describe the language proficiency of learners.
## Installation via pip üì¶
Easily install the CEFR Level Classifier package with pip:
```bash
pip install CEFR-Classifier-French
```
## Example Usage üåü
Here's a quick example of how to use the `CEFR-Classifier-French` package to predict the CEFR level of a French sentence:

```python
from CEFR_Classifier_French.inference.predict import Predictor

predictor = Predictor()

# Predict the CEFR level of a text
text = "Je ne sais pas quoi dire."

level = predictor.inference_sentence(text)

print("Level of the sentence is -> ", level)
```

## How to Run the GUI üöÄ
### On Your Own Computer

```
3. **Install the Requirements**: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run the Streamlit App**: 
```
streamlit run CEFR_Classifier_French/app.py
```

## About Our Model ü§ñ
Our application utilizes the Camembert model, a cutting-edge language processing model, structured in a unique three-phase system to accurately assess and classify texts:
1. **Phase 1 - Initial Classification**: This phase classifies texts into broad categories: A, B, or C.
2. **Phase 2 - Detailed Assessment**: 
   - **Phase 2 A**: Distinguishes between A1 and A2 levels for texts classified as 'A' in Phase 1.
   - **Phase 2 B**: Distinguishes between B1 and B2 levels for texts classified as 'A' in Phase 1.
   - **Phase 2 C**: Distinguishes between C1 and C2 levels for texts classified as 'A' in Phase 1.

This multi-phase approach ensures precise and nuanced classification in line with CEFR standards.

## How to Use the App üñ±Ô∏è
1. **Navigation**: Use the sidebar to easily navigate through the application.
2. **Training the Model**: Head over to the **Training** section üë®‚Äçüè´. Here, you can train the model with your dataset, allowing it to learn and adapt to your specific language use cases.
3. **Text Classification**: Visit the **Inference** section üîç to input text. The app will analyze the text and provide you with its CEFR level classification.

## Our Model's Evolution ü§ñ
### Initial Attempts
- **Logistic Regression Approach**: We began by analyzing sentence structure - counting length, verbs, punctuation, and checking for passive sentences. Despite these efforts, a logistic regression model yielded unsatisfactory results.

### Transition to Camembert Model
- **First Camembert Trial**: Shifting gears, we implemented a Camembert language model. Although it improved accuracy to 58%, the model's size and training speed were concerning.

### Final, Optimized Model
- **Two-Phase Camembert System**: Our breakthrough came with a refined version of the Camembert model, structured in two phases for precise, efficient classification. This significantly accelerated training times without compromising accuracy. It even increased it to 60,2% with the same dataset.
