# Welcome to the CEFR Level Classifier Project! 🚀

[![Run in Saturn Cloud](https://saturncloud.io/images/embed/run-in-saturn-cloud.svg)](https://app.community.saturnenterprise.io/dash/o/community/resources?templateId=1eea18712f1c498b81567ea0e854df87)

This application, built using Streamlit 🌐, leverages the advanced capabilities of a 3-phase Camembert model 🧀 to classify texts into the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR): A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2.

## What is CEFR? 📘
The CEFR is an internationally recognized standard for describing language ability. It's widely used across the globe to assess and describe the language proficiency of learners.

## About Our Model 🤖
Our application utilizes the Camembert model, a cutting-edge language processing model. This model has been specifically adapted and fine-tuned in three distinct phases to accurately assess and classify texts according to their language complexity and corresponding CEFR levels.

## How to Use the App 🖱️
1. **Navigation**: Use the sidebar to easily navigate through the application.
2. **Training the Model**: Head over to the **Training** section 👨‍🏫. Here, you can train the model with your dataset, allowing it to learn and adapt to your specific language use cases.
3. **Text Classification**: Visit the **Inference** section 🔍 to input text. The app will analyze the text and provide you with its CEFR level classification.
